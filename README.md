# CubeTimer

An in-development speedcubing timer. Speedcubing is the competitive solving of the Rubik's Cube and other related puzzles, and while speedcubing timer web applications do exist, they are few and their continued development is limited. As this application is very early in development, it is not yet deployed anywhere. Updates will be found here, and it will be deployed when a stable main branch has been completed.
